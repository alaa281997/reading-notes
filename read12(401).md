#### Spring RequestMapping
> @RequestMapping Basics
 -a method using some basic criteria.
 > @RequestMapping — by Path 
 @RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
 > @RequestMapping — the HTTP Method
 - The HTTP method parameter has no default. So, if we don't specify a value, it's going to map to any HTTP request

> RequestMapping and HTTP Headers
 - @RequestMapping With the headers Attribute
  - The mapping can be narrowed even further by specifying a  header for the request
 
 - @RequestMapping Consumes and Produces
  > Mapping media types produced by a controller method is worth special attention.

> RequestMapping With Path Variables
 - Single @PathVariable
 - Multiple @PathVariable
    - when we need to map multiple parts of the URI to multiple values
 -  @PathVariable With Regex
    - we will restrict the mapping to only accept numerical values for the id

> RequestMapping With Request Parameters
 - mapping of URL parameters with the @RequestParam annotation.

>  RequestMapping Corner Cases
 -  @RequestMapping — Multiple Paths Mapped to the Same Controller Method
   -  the value attribute of @RequestMapping does accept multiple mappings
 - @RequestMapping — Multiple HTTP Request Methods to the Same Controller Method
  - Multiple requests using different HTTP verbs can be mapped to the same controller method

 - @RequestMapping — a Fallback for All Requests
 - Ambiguous Mapping Error

> New Request Mapping Shortcuts
 - @GetMapping
 - @PostMapping
 - @PutMapping
 - @DeleteMapping
 - @PatchMapping


> Build an executable JAR
 Building an executable jar makes it easy to ship, version, and deploy the service as an application throughout the development lifecycle, across different environments, and so forth.

> Spring Data Repositories
 - CrudRepository provides CRUD functions
 - PagingAndSortingRepository provides methods to do  pagination and sort records
 - JpaRepository provides JPA related methods such as flushing the persistence context and delete records in a batch

> CrudRepository
 - save(…) – save an Iterable of entities. Here, we can pass  multiple objects to save them in a batch
 - findOne(…) – get a single entity based on passed primary key value
 - findAll() – get an Iterable of all available entities in database
 - count() – return the count of total entities in a table
 - delete(…) – delete an entity based on the passed object
 - exists(…) – verify if an entity exists based on the passed primary key value 

> PagingAndSortingRepository
 When using Pageable, we need to create a Pageable object with certain properties:
 - Page size
 - Current page number
 - Sorting

> JpaRepository
- findAll() – get a List of all available entities in database
- findAll(…) – get a List of all available entities and sort them using the provided condition
- save(…) – save an Iterable of entities. Here, we can pass multiple objects to save them in a batch
- flush() – flush all pending task to the database
- saveAndFlush(…) – save the entity and flush changes immediately
- deleteInBatch(…) – delete an Iterable of entities. Here, we can pass multiple objects to delete them in a batch
