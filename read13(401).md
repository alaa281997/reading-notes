### Relationships in Spring Data REST

> One-to-One Relationship
 - The Data Model
   Two entity classes Library and Address having a one-to-one relationship, using the @OneToOne annotation.
   *We must be careful to have different names for each association resource*

 - The Repositories
    two repository interfaces for each of them, by extending the CrudRepository interface

 - Creating the Resources
    add a Library instance to work with it

 - Creating the Associations
   we can establish the relationship by using one of the association resources.This is done using the HTTP method PUT.


> One-to-Many Relationship
  @OneToMany and @ManyToOne

> Many-to-Many Relationship
 A many-to-many relationship is defined using @ManyToMany annotation.

> Testing the Endpoints With TestRestTemplate
 We can test One-to-One Relationship, One-to-Many Relationship and Many-to-Many Relationship

 ##### Integration Testing in Spring
we need the latest junit-jupiter-engine, junit-jupiter-api, and Spring test dependencies

>  Spring MVC Test Configuration
 - Enable Spring in Tests with JUnit 5
   JUnit 5 defines an extension interface through which classes can integrate with the JUnit test.
    by adding the @ExtendWith annotation to our test classes and specifying the extension class to load. 
 - The WebApplicationContext Object
    WebApplicationContext provides a web application configuration. It loads all the application beans and controllers into the context.

 - Mocking Web Context Beans
    It encapsulates all web application beans and makes them available for testing.

 - Verify Test Configuration
   the WebApplicationContext object (webApplicationContext) properly. We'll also check that the right servletContext is being attached

> Writing Integration Tests
  - Verify View Name
     We can invoke the /homePage endpoint from our test as:
       http://localhost:8080/spring-mvc-test/

    - perform() method will call a GET request method.
    - andDo(print()) will print the request and response.
    - andExpect() will expect the provided argument.

  - Verify Response Body
     We'll invoke the /greet endpoint from our test as:
     http://localhost:8080/spring-mvc-test/greet

  -  Send GET Request With Path Variable
      We'll invoke the /greetWithPathVariable/{name} endpoint from our test as:
      http://localhost:8080/spring-mvc-test/greetWithPathVariable/John

  - Send GET Request With Query Parameters
   We'll invoke the /greetWithQueryVariable?name={name} endpoint from our test as: http://localhost:8080/spring-mvc-test/greetWithQueryVariable?name=John%20Doe

  - Send POST Request
    We'll invoke the /greetWithPost endpoint from our test as:
    http://localhost:8080/spring-mvc-test/greetWithPost

> MockMvc Limitations
MockMvc provides an elegant and easy-to-use API to call web endpoints and to inspect and assert their response at the same time. Despite all its benefits, it has a few limitations.
