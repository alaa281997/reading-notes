> A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a  collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges

- Vertex (node) -> is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- Edge -> An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- Neighbor -> The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are  connected via an edge
- Degree -> The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

> Undirected Graph -> does not move in any direction.
> Directed Graphs -> is a graph where every edge is directed.

> Complete Graphs -> is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
> Connected -> is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
> Disconnected -> is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.


#### Acyclic vs Cyclic
> Acyclic Graph -> is a directed graph without cycles. A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

> Cyclic Graphs -> A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles. A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.

#### Graph Representation
> Adjacency Matrix -> An Adjacency matrix is represented through a  2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix

*a sparse graph is when there are very few connections. a dense graph is when there are many connections*

> Adjacency List -> An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs. An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

#### Weighted Graphs
> A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights. When representing a weighted graph in a matrix, you set the element in the 2D array to represent the actual weight between the two paths.


#### Traversals
> Breadth-first search is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property.

> Depth First
The first thing that we are going to do is look at the root. Before looking at the rest of Node A’s children, we will look at the children of first Node. and start visiting children that haven’t yet been visited.
