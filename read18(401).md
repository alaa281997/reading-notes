### Hibernate Many to Many Annotation Tutorial

> Introduction
  In this quick tutorial, we'll have a quick look at how the @ManyToMany annotation can be used for specifying this type of relationships in Hibernate.

> A Typical Example
 Let's start with a simple Entity Relationship Diagram â€“ which shows the many-to-many association between two entities employee and project

> Database Setup
Let's assume we have an already created database with the name spring_hibernate_many_to_many.

> The Model Classes
 The model classes Employee and Project need to be created with JPA annotations.
 The @ManyToMany annotation is used in both classes to create the many-to-many relationship  between the entities.

 This association has two sides i.e. the owning side and the inverse side.  

> Execution
 In order to see the many-to-many annotation in action, we can write the following JUnit

 public class HibernateManyToManyAnnotationMainIntegrationTest {
    private static SessionFactory sessionFactory;
    private Session session;

    // ...

    @Test
    public void givenData_whenInsert_thenCreatesMtoMrelationship() {
        String[] employeeData = { "Peter Oven", "Allan Norman" };
        String[] projectData = { "IT Project", "Networking Project" };
        Set<Project> projects = new HashSet<>();

        for (String proj : projectData) {
            projects.add(new Project(proj));
        }

        for (String emp : employeeData) {
            Employee employee = new Employee(emp.split(" ")[0], 
              emp.split(" ")[1]);
 
            assertEquals(0, employee.getProjects().size());
            employee.setProjects(projects);
            session.persist(employee);
 
            assertNotNull(employee);
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void givenSession_whenRead_thenReturnsMtoMdata() {
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        List<Employee> employeeList = session.createQuery("FROM Employee")
          .list();
 
        assertNotNull(employeeList);
 
        for(Employee employee : employeeList) {
            assertNotNull(employee.getProjects());
        }
    }

    // ...
 }
