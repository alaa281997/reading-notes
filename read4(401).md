### Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
> What Is an Object?
 Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior. Dogs have state (name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior (barking, fetching, wagging tail).  Identifying the state and behavior for real-world objects is a great way to begin thinking in terms of object-oriented programming.

> What Is a Class?
 when find many individual objects all of the same kind to have instances without repetition

> What Is Inheritance?
 Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes

> What Is an Interface?
 Methods form the object's interface with the outside world; the buttons on the front of your television set, for example, are the interface between you and the electrical wiring on the other side of its plastic casing.

>What Is a Package?
 A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.


> This is a class declaration
 class MyClass {
    // field, constructor, and 
    // method declarations
}

> There are several kinds of variables:

- Member variables in a class—these are called fields.
- Variables in a method or block of code—these are called local variables.
- Variables in method declarations—these are called parameters.


> method declaration:

public double calculateAnswer(double wingSpan, int numberOfEngines,
    double length, double grossTons) {
    //do the calculation here
}

*The declaration for a method or a constructor declares the number and the type of the arguments for that method or constructor.*


> Decimals
How do Decimal Numbers work?

Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position is which

> Bases
The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols

> Counting with Different Number Systems
But you don't have to use 10 as a "Base". You could use 2 ("Binary"), 16 ("Hexadecimal"), or any number you want to

> Binary Numbers
Binary Numbers are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits ... so you start back at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1


> Hexadecimal Numbers
They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15
