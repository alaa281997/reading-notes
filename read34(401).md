 Choose a monetization model for your app there are two primary ways you can accept payments: Google Play's billing system and Google Pay.

> Google Play's billing system:
  Items that require developers to use Google Play's billing system include the following:
 - Virtual game products, such as coins, gems, extra lives or turns, special items or equipment, characters or avatars, additional levels or playtime.
 - App functionality or content, such as an ad-free version of an app or new features not available in the free version.
 - Subscription services, such as streaming media, digital publications, and social networking services.
 - Cloud software products, including data storage services, business productivity software, and financial management software.

> Google Pay
 Why recommend developers to use Google Pay include the following:
 - Retail merchandise, such as groceries, clothing, housewares, and electronics.
 - Physical services, including taxi and transportation services, cleaning services, food delivery, airfare, and event tickets.
 - One-time membership fees or recurring dues, including gym memberships, loyalty programs, or clubs offering accessories, clothing, or other physical products.
 - Electronic bill payment, including credit card bills, utilities, and cable or telecommunications services.

> Other app monetization options:
 - Advertising
 - Paid apps

> Monetization strategy
 - Research other apps in your category: Learn how other developers charge for their apps and content. 
 - Think about how your app will be used: Your app's usage patterns can indicate the best monetization choices. 
 - Make use of natural extensions: If your app can be extended or expanded, such as with adding levels in a game, consider making the core app available for free and offering extended features through in-app purchases or subscriptions.
 - Consider your cost structures: If you have significant recurring content costs, consider using subscriptions. Use a free trial period to encourage uptake.
 - Consider your audience: For some audiences, the scope for using advertising, subscriptions, or in-app purchases can be limited. For example, users are more likely to pay for an ad-free, kid-friendly app than a casual use app. In these cases, premium (paid) apps are more appropriate.
 - Consider local factors when setting prices: When setting prices for apps, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in specific markets, be sure to consider cost of living differences, local pricing patterns, pricing of competitive apps, and other market factors.
