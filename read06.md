# CSS
## css allows you to create rules that specify how content of an element should appear 
# A CSS rule
### contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
 - Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to
     more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.
 - Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.
    Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon.

### CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon.
 - Properties indicate the aspects  of the element you want to change. For example, color, font,
       width, height and border.

 - Values specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you
    want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text in these elements to be.

**Using External CSS**
 <link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css"  rel="stylesheet" />
   > herf : path // type : attribute // rel : relation between html and css 


## Using Internal CSS
The <style> element should use the type attribute to indicate that the styles are specified in
CSS. The value should be text/css.



# colors

#### three ways:
- RGB values
- HEX codes
- color names

## Color pickers can help you find the color you want. Color picking tools are available in image editing programs like Photoshop and GIMP.

### CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).

- hue
 - This is expressed as an angle (between 0 and 360 degrees). saturation This is expressed as a percentage.
- lightness
 - This is expressed as a percentage with 0% being white, 50% being normal, and 100% being black. The hsla color property allows you to specify color properties using hue, saturation, and lightness as above, and adds a fourth value which represents transparency (just like the rgba property). The a stands for:
- alpha
 - This is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.0. For example, 0.5 represents 50% transparency, and 0.75 represents 75% transparency.
