## HashTable


> Hash
  A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose.

> Buckets
 A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.

> Collisions 
 A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

*Uses :*
 - Hold unique values
 - Dictionary
 - Library


*The basic idea of a hashtable is the ability to store the key into this data structure, and quickly retrieve the value. This is done through what we call a hash. A hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.*

Structure
Hashing
*A hash code turns a key into an integer. It’s very important that hash codes are deterministic: their output is determined only by their input. Hash codes should never have randomness to them. The same key should always produce the same hash code.*

Creating a Hash
*A hashtable traditionally is created from an array. I always like the size 1024*


*Here is a possible suggestion:*
- Add or multiply all the ASCII values together.
- Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.
- Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total  size of the array.
- Insert into the array at that index.

> Collisions
 A collision occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array. As mentioned earlier, a “perfect hash” will never have any collisions. To put this into perspective, the worst possible hash is one that hashes every single key to the same exact index of an array. 


Hash maps do this to store values:

- accept a key
- calculate the hash of the key
- use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
- store the key with the value by appending both to the end of a linked list

Hash maps do this to read value:
- accept a key
- calculate the hash of the key
- use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
- use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket
- search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value pair that - matches the key you were given.


> Bucket Sizes
 Hash Maps can have any number of buckets. If a hash map has only a few buckets it will be densely full and have many collisions. If a hash map has more buckets it will be more sparsely populated, there will be less collisions, but there may be a lot of extra empty space.

> Internal Methods
- Add()
  - send the key to the GetHash method.
  - Once you determine the index of where it should be placed, go to that index
  - Check if something exists at that index already, if it doesn’t, add it  with the key/value pair.
  - If something does exist, add the new key/value pair to the data structure within that bucket.

- Find()
 The Find takes in a key, gets the Hash, and goes to the index location specified. Once at the index location is found in the array, it is then the responsibility of the algorithm the iterate through the bucket and see if the key exists and return the value.

- Contains()
 The Contains method will accept a key, and return a bool on if that key exists inside the hashtable. The best way to do this is to have the contains call the GetHash and check the hashtable if the key exists in the table given the index returned.

- GetHash()
 The GetHash will accept a key as a string, conduct the hash, and then return the index of the array where the key/value should be placed.



> Basics of Hash Tables
 Assume that you have an object and you want to assign a key to it to make searching easy. To store the key/value pair, you can use a simple array like a data structure where keys (integers) can be used directly as an index to store values. However, in cases where the keys are large and cannot be used directly as an index, you should use hashing.

> Hashing is implemented in two steps:

  - An element is converted into an integer by using a hash function. This element can be used as an index to store the original element, which falls into the hash table.
 - The element is stored in the hash table where it can be quickly retrieved using hashed key.
  hash = hashfunc(key)
  index = hash % array_size

> Hash function
 A hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table. 


> hash function with the following basic requirements:

 -  Easy to compute: It should be easy to compute and must not become an  algorithm in itself.

 - Uniform distribution: It should provide a uniform distribution across the hash table and should not result in clustering.

 - Less collisions: Collisions occur when pairs of elements are mapped to the same hash value. These should be avoided.
