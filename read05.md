# comparison operators
 I learned about comparison operators
 first, the operator that shows the result true or false (boolean)

 
- != is not equal to (value)
- == is equal to (value)
- === strict equal to (data type & value)
- !== strict not equal to (data type & value)
- > greater than
- < less than
- >= greater than or equal to 
- <= less than or equal to

#### logical operators
allow you to compare the resuts of more than one comparison operator
(("Hello" == "Hello") && (2 >= 5))

- &&/AND this operator tests more than one condition
 - T && T = TRUE
 - T && F = FALSE
 - F && T = FALSE
 - F && F = FALSE

- ||/OR this operator tests at least one conditions
 - T || T = TRUE
 - T || F = TRUE
 - F || T = TRUE
 - F || F = FALSE

- !/NOT this operator takes a single boolean value and invertsit
 - !true = false
 - !false = true

#### loops 
loops check a condition if it returns true a code block will run 
then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true,
the code block will run again it repeats until the condition returns false there are three common types of loops:
- for = a condition usually a counter.
- while = if the condition is true it will keep run
- do while = it will always run the statments at least once even if the condition evaluates to false

- for loop 
 - for (Initialization; condition ; update )

- while loop 
 - while (i<5){
    This loop will continue to run
    for as long as the condition in
     the parentheses is true. T
    }
