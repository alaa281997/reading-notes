### Room


>  The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to  allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. In particular, Room provides the following benefits:
 - Compile-time verification of SQL queries.
 - Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.
 - Streamlined database migration paths.


> Primary components
 There are three major components in Room:
 - The database class that holds the database and serves as the main access  point for the underlying connection to your app's persisted data.
 - Data entities that represent tables in your app's database.
 - Data access objects (DAOs) that provide methods that your app can use to query, update, insert, and delete data in the database.


> Database:
- The class must be annotated with a @Database annotation that includes an entities array that lists all of the data entities associated with the database.
- The class must be an abstract class that extends RoomDatabase.
- For each DAO class that is associated with the database, the database class must define an abstract method that has zero arguments and returns an instance of the DAO class.

> Defining data using Room entities:
- Anatomy of an entity->
  A Room entity includes fields for each column in the corresponding table in the database, including one or more columns that comprise the primary key.

> Define a primary key
 Uniquely identifies each row in the corresponding database table.

 ```
 @PrimaryKey
 public int id;
 ```

> Define a composite primary key
> 
  ```
  @Entity(primaryKeys = {"firstName", "lastName"})
  public class User {
    public String firstName;
    public String lastName;
  }
  ```



> Ignore fields
 Room creates a column for each field that's defined in the entity. If an entity has fields that you don't want to persist, you can annotate them using @Ignore


    ```
    @Ignore
    Bitmap picture;
    ```



### Define relationships between objects 
> Embedded objects
 You can use the @Embedded annotation to represent an object that you'd  like to decompose into its subfields within a table. You can then query the embedded fields just as you would for other individual columns.

> Define one-to-one relationships
 A one-to-one relationship between two entities is a relationship where each instance of the parent entity corresponds to exactly one instance of the child entity, and vice-versa.

> Define one-to-many relationships
 A one-to-many relationship between two entities is a relationship where each instance of the parent entity corresponds to zero or more instances of the child entity, but each instance of the child entity can only correspond to exactly one instance of the parent entity.

> Define many-to-many relationships
 A many-to-many relationship between two entities is a relationship where each instance of the parent entity corresponds to zero or more instances of the child entity, and vice-versa.

> Define nested relationships
 You might need to query a set of three or more tables that are all related to each other. In that case, you would define nested relationships between the tables.


### Anatomy of a DAO
 > You can define each DAO as either an interface or an abstract class. For basic use cases, you should usually use an interface. In either case, you must always annotate your DAOs with @Dao. DAOs don't have properties, but they do define one or more methods for interacting with the data in your app's database.

>  Two types of DAO methods:
 - Convenience methods that let you insert, update, and delete rows in your database without writing any SQL code.
 - Query methods that let you write your own SQL query to interact with the database.

> Convenience methods
 - Insert
  The @Insert annotation allows you to define methods that insert their parameters into the appropriate table in the database.

 - Update
  The @Update annotation allows you to define methods that update specific rows in a database table. 

 - Delete
  The @Delete annotation allows you to define methods that delete specific
