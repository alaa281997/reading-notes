# Amplify and Cognito

> Amplify Auth category provides an interface for authenticating a user. Behind the scenes, it provides the necessary authorization to the other Amplify categories.
> Sign in a user
Implement a UI to get the username and password from the user. 

```
Amplify.Auth.signIn(
    "username",
    "password",
    result -> Log.i("AuthQuickstart", result.isSignInComplete() ? "Sign in succeeded" : "Sign in not complete"),
    error -> Log.e("AuthQuickstart", error.toString())
);
```


> Multi-factor authentication
  Some steps in setting up multi-factor authentication can only be chosen during the initial setup of Auth. If you have already added Auth via the CLI, navigate to your project directory in Terminal, run amplify auth remove and when that completes, amplify push to remove it.

> Auth events
 AWS Cognito Auth Plugin sends important events through Amplify Hub.

> Remember a device
  Remembering a device is useful in conjunction with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). If MFA is enabled for an Amazon Cognito user pool, end users have to type in a security code received via e-mail or SMS each time they want to sign in.


>Sign out
 Invoke the signOut api to sign out a user from the Auth category. You can only have one user signed in at a given time.
```
 Amplify.Auth.signOut(
    () -> Log.i("AuthQuickstart", "Signed out successfully"),
    error -> Log.e("AuthQuickstart", error.toString())
 );
```
