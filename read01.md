##### First of all I start read about IDE I used a lot of IDE and I surely agree about features should we have when we start coding for example highlighting / automictic closing tag and a lot of things that will save our time.

##### Second chapter about CML also I used CML when I use my computer it save my time I recap my knowledge of CML for example (PWD It means print current directory and LS means list all main folder / ls - la means list all main folder with hidden folder / clear : when we want to clear all command on the window / mkdir to create new directory/folder / cd means to move back to the previous directory and we can create file by using touch.
