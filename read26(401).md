### Andriod 
 Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages. The Android SDK tools compile your code along with any data and resource files into an APK or an Android App Bundle.
 An Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk.

### Android security features:
 - The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.
 - By default, the system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID (the ID is used only by the system and is unknown to the app). The system sets permissions for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.
 - Each process has its own virtual machine (VM), so an app's code runs in isolation from other apps.
 - By default, every app runs in its own Linux process. The Android system starts the process when any of the app's components need to be executed, and then shuts down the process when it's no longer needed or when the system must recover memory for other apps. 

### App components:
 - Activities
 - Services
 - Broadcast receivers
 - Content providers

### Activities
 An activity is the entry point for interacting with the user. It represents a single screen with a user interface. 

### Services
 A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons.
 It is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes.

### Broadcast receivers
 A broadcast receiver is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. Because broadcast receivers are another well-defined entry into the app, the system can deliver broadcasts even to apps that aren't currently running.

### Content providers
 A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access.

### Managing an app:
 Assigning a URI doesn't require that the app remain running, so URIs can persist after their owning apps have exited. The system only needs to make sure that an owning app is still running when it has to retrieve the app's data from the corresponding URI.
 These URIs also provide an important fine-grained security model. For example, an app can place the URI for an image it has on the clipboard, but leave its content provider locked up so that other apps cannot freely access it. When a second app attempts to access that URI on the clipboard, the system can allow that app to access the data via a temporary URI permission grant so that it is allowed to access the data only behind that URI, but nothing else in the second app.

### Activating each type of component:

 - You can start an activity or give it something new to do by passing an Intent to startActivity() or startActivityForResult() (when you want the activity to return a result).
 - With Android 5.0 (API level 21) and later, you can use the JobScheduler class to schedule actions. For earlier Android versions, you can start a service (or give new instructions to an ongoing service) by passing an Intent to startService(). You can bind to the service by passing an Intent to bindService().
 - You can initiate a broadcast by passing an Intent to methods such as sendBroadcast(), sendOrderedBroadcast(), or sendStickyBroadcast().
 - You can perform a query to a content provider by calling query() on a ContentResolver.

### Declaring components
 > <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <manifest ... >
    <application android:icon="@drawable/app_icon.png" ... >
        <activity android:name="com.example.project.ExampleActivity"
                  android:label="@string/example_label" ... >
        </activity>
        ...
    </application>
   </manifest> 

### You must declare all app components using the following elements:

 <activity> elements for activities.
 <service> elements for services.
 <receiver> elements for broadcast receivers.
 <provider> elements for content providers.
