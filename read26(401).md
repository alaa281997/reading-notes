### Andriod 
 Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages. The Android SDK tools compile your code along with any data and resource files into an APK or an Android App Bundle.
 An Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk.

### Android security features:
 - The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.
 - By default, the system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID (the ID is used only by the system and is unknown to the app). The system sets permissions for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.
 - Each process has its own virtual machine (VM), so an app's code runs in isolation from other apps.
 - By default, every app runs in its own Linux process. The Android system starts the process when any of the app's components need to be executed, and then shuts down the process when it's no longer needed or when the system must recover memory for other apps. 

### App components:
 - Activities
 - Services
 - Broadcast receivers
 - Content providers
