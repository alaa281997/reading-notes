### Trees

*Terminology*
- Node A Tree node is contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes
- Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf


> Traversals
  Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree.
  > Depth First
    Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. 
  - Pre-order: root >> left >> right ex: A, B, D, E, C, F
  - In-order: left >> root >> right ex: D, B, E, A, F, C
  - Post-order: left >> right >> root ex: D, E, B, F, C, A


 > Breadth First
 Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. 

> Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees
  Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).

  *K-ary Trees*
 if Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree. In this type of tree we use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have

> Big O
 The Big O space complexity for a node insertion using breadth first insertion will be O(w), where w is the largest width of the tree. For example, in the above tree, w is 4.

> Binary Search Trees
 nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.

 The Big O time complexity of a Binary Search Tree’s insertion and search operations is O(h), or O(height).
