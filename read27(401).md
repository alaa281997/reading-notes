> When the current activity starts another, the new activity is pushed on the top of the stack   and takes focus. The previous activity remains in the stack, but is stopped. When an activity stops, the system retains the current state of its user interface. When the user presses the Back button, the current activity is popped from the top of the stack (the activity is destroyed) and the previous activity resumes (the previous state of its UI is restored). Activities in the stack are never rearranged, only pushed and popped from the stack—pushed onto the stack when started by the current activity and popped off when the user leaves it using the Back button.

> Managing Tasks
 The way Android manages tasks and the back stack, as described above—by placing all activities started in succession in the same task and in a "last in, first out" stack—works great for most apps and you shouldn't have to worry about how your activities are associated with tasks or how they exist in the back stack.

>  activity attributes you can use are:
 taskAffinity
 launchMode
 allowTaskReparenting
 clearTaskOnLaunch
 alwaysRetainTaskState
 finishOnTaskLaunch

> Defining launch modes
 Launch modes allow you to define how a new instance of an activity is associated with the current task. You can define different launch modes in two ways:

 - Using the manifest file
 When you declare an activity in your manifest file, you can specify how the activity should associate with tasks when it starts.

 - Using Intent flags
 When you call startActivity(), you can include a flag in the Intent that declares how (or whether) the new activity should associate with the current task.

> Using Intent flags
 When starting an activity, you can modify the default association of an activity to its task by including flags in the intent that you deliver to startActivity(). The flags you can use to modify the default behavior are:

 - FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK
  Start the activity in a new task. If a task is already running for the activity you are now starting, that task is brought to the foreground with its last state restored and the activity receives the new intent in onNewIntent().
  This produces the same behavior as the "singleTask" launchMode value, discussed in the previous section.

 - FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP
 If the activity being started is the current activity (at the top of the back stack), then the existing instance receives a call to onNewIntent(), instead of creating a new instance of the activity.
 This produces the same behavior as the "singleTop" launchMode value, discussed in the previous section.

 - FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP
 If the activity being started is already running in the current task, then instead of launching a new instance of that activity, all of the other activities on top of it are destroyed and this intent is delivered to the resumed instance of the activity (now on top), through onNewIntent()).
 There is no value for the launchMode attribute that produces this behavior.

 - FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP is most often used in conjunction with FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK. When   used together, these flags are a way of locating an existing activity in another task and putting it in a position where it can respond to the intent.

> Handling affinities
 The affinity indicates which task an activity prefers to belong to. By default, all the activities from the same app have an affinity for each other. So, by default, all activities in the same app prefer to be in the same task. However, you can modify the default affinity for an activity. Activities defined in different apps can share an affinity, or activities defined in the same app can be assigned different task affinities.
