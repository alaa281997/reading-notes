# S3


> S3 -> 
 Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to  store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, and inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. 

> Advantages of using Amazon S3
 - Creating buckets – Create and name a bucket that stores data. 

 - Storing data – Store an infinite amount of data in a bucket. Upload as many objects as you like into an Amazon S3 bucket.
  
 - Downloading data – Download your data or enable others to do so. 

 - Permissions – Grant or deny access to others who want to upload or download data into your Amazon S3 bucket. 

 - Standard interfaces – Use standards-based REST and SOAP interfaces designed to work with any internet-development toolkit.


> Buckets
 A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. Every object is contained in a bucket.

> Buckets serve several purposes:

- They organize the Amazon S3 namespace at the highest level.

- They identify the account responsible for storage and data transfer charges.

- They play a role in access control.

- They serve as the unit of aggregation for usage reporting.


> Objects
 Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. Objects consist of object data and metadata.

> Keys
 A key is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket. 

> Regions
 You can choose the geographical AWS Region where Amazon S3 will store the buckets that you create. 

> Amazon S3 data consistency model
 Amazon S3 provides strong read-after-write consistency for PUTs and DELETEs of objects in your Amazon S3 bucket in all AWS Regions.

> Amazon S3 application programming interfaces (API)
 The Amazon S3 architecture is designed to be programming language-neutral, using AWS Supported interfaces to store and retrieve objects.
