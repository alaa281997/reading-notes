### Linked Lists
> A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/   linked to each other.

### Terminology
- Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that  links/points to the next node in the list
  
- Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
- Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

- Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

- Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.

- Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

- Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at.


##### Traversal

you are not able to use a foreach or for loop. 
The best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a while() loop check that the Next node in the list is not null.

- Traversal Big O
The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n) the very last node in the linked list. n represents the number of nodes 

- Adding a Node
If we want to add a node with an O(1) efficiency, we have to replace the current Head of the linked list with the new node, without losing the reference to the next node in the list.



##### Linear data structures
which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed in non-linear data structures, items don’t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially


> Memory management
When an array is created, it needs a certain amount of memory. If we had 7 letters that we needed to store in an array, we would need 7 bytes of memory to represent that array.

The fundamental difference between arrays and linked lists is that arrays are static data structures, while linked lists are dynamic data structures


> Lists for all shapes and sizes

Singly linked lists are the simplest type of linked list, based solely on the fact that they only go in one direction. There is a single track that we can traverse the list in; we start at the head node, and traverse from the root until the last node, which will end at an empty null value.

But just as a node can reference its subsequent neighbor node, it can also have a reference pointer to its preceding node, too! This is what we call a doubly linked list, because there are two references contained within each node: a reference to the next node, as well as the previous node

 circular linked list is a little odd in that it doesn’t end with a node pointing to a null value.




#### Big O
> Big O Notation
  is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function
  there are a ton of different equations used to define the space and time complexity of an algorithm, and most of them involve an O (referred to as just “O” or sometimes as “order”), and a variable n, where n is the size of the input 


> Growing a linked list
  Inserting an element at the beginning of a linked list is particularly nice and efficient because it takes the same amount of time, no matter how long our list is
