>Get Location
  When your app is connected to these you can use the fused location provider's getLastLocation() method to retrieve the device location.

  ```
  fusedLocationClient.getLastLocation()
        .addOnSuccessListener(this, new OnSuccessListener<Location>() {
            @Override
            public void onSuccess(Location location) {
                // Got last known location. In some rare situations this can be null.
                if (location != null) {
                    // Logic to handle location object
                }
            }
        })
 ```

 *The getLastLocation() method returns a Task that you can use to get a Location object with the latitude and longitude coordinates of a geographic location.*

> The location object may be null in the following case: 
 - Location is turned off in the device settings.
 - The device never recorded its location, which could be the case of a new
   device or a device that has been restored to factory settings.
 - Google Play services on the device has restarted.

> FusedLocationProviderClient provides several methods to retrieve device  location information :
 - getLastLocation() gets a location estimate more quickly and minimizes battery usage that can be attributed to your app. 
 - getCurrentLocation() gets a fresher, more accurate location more consistently.
