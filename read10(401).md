#### Stacks and Queues

> What is a Stack 
 A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack.

> Terminology for a stack:
 - Push : Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed.
 - Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped.
 - Top - This is the top of the stack.
 - Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. 
 - IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

> Stacks :
- FILO
  First In Last Out
- LIFO
  Last In First Out

> Stack Visualization:
  When you push something to the stack, it becomes the new top. When you pop something from the stack, you pop the current top and set the next top as top.next.

> Push O(1)
 Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. 
> Pop O(1)
 Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top.
> Peek O(1)
 When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.
> IsEmpty O(1)
Here is the pseudocode for isEmpty


### What is a Queue ?
- Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. 
- Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue.


### Queues follow these concepts:
- FIFO
 First In First Out
- LILO
 Last In Last Out.




> Enqueue O(1)
 When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation.

> Dequeue O(1)
When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1).

> Peek O(1)
When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

> IsEmpty O(1)
Here is the pseudocode for isEmpty
