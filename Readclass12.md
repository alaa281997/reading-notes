Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
SQL	NoSQL
 	 

| SQL                                                             | NoSQL                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Relational Databases (RDBMS)                                    | Non-relational or distributed database.                                |
| MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL                      | MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb |
| for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. | database, queries are focused on collection of documents               |
| SQL databases are vertically scalable                           | databases are horizontally scalable.                                   |



 	 
- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
 SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL don’t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language

- Give a real world example.
   MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. 
 
- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
 NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

- Give a real world example.
  NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
   NoSQL
- Which type of database is best for scalability?
   NoSQL databases




#### Video

- What does SQL stand for?
 Structured Query Language.
- What is a realational database?
   relational database is a type of database. It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database.

- What type of structure does a relational database work with?
 data structures

- What is a ‘schema’?
   A schema is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema objects.

- What is a NoSQL database?
  Not relational database

- Howo does it work?
    inside one document 

- What is inside of a Mongo database?
  documents

- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
   MongoDB flexible using

- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
  Less mature
