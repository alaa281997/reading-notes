### Packages and Import
Package = directory. Java classes can be grouped together in packages. A package name is the same as the directory (folder) name which contains the .java files. You declare packages when you define your Java program, and you name the packages you want to use from other libraries in an import statement.

##### Package declaration syntax
- Package statment (optional).
- Imports (optional).
- Class or interface definitions.

##### Common imports

- import java.awt.*;	Common GUI elements.
- import java.awt.event.*;	The most common GUI event listeners.
- import javax.swing.*;	More common GUI elements. Note "javax".
- import java.util.*;	Data structures (Collections), time, Scanner, etc classes.
- import java.io.*;	Input-output classes.
- import java.text.*;	Some formatting classes.
- import java.util.regex.*;	Regular expression classes.


### Intro to Loops
In programming languages, looping is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates to false.

Java provides different types of loops to fit any programming need. Each loop has its own purpose and a suitable use case to serve.

*Here are the types of loops that we can find in Java:*
- Simple for loop
- Enhanced for-each loop
- While loop
- Do-While loop

### For Loop
A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.


### While Loop
The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.


### Do-While Loop
The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.
