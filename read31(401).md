# Espresso 
 Espresso to write concise, beautiful, and reliable Android UI tests.

> Target audience
 Espresso is targeted at developers, who believe that automated testing is an integral part of the development lifecycle. 

> Synchronization capabilities
 Espresso waits to perform the corresponding UI action or assertion until the following synchronization conditions are met:

 - The message queue is empty.
 - There are no instances of AsyncTask currently executing a task.
 - All developer-defined idling resources are idle.


> Packages: 
 - espresso-core - Contains core and basic View matchers, actions, and  assertions. See Basics and Recipes.
 - espresso-web - Contains resources for WebView support.
 - espresso-idling-resource - Espresso's mechanism for synchronization with background jobs.
 - espresso-contrib - External contributions that contain DatePicker, RecyclerView and Drawer actions, accessibility checks, and CountingIdlingResource.
 - espresso-intents - Extension to validate and stub intents for hermetic testing.
 - espresso-remote - Location of Espresso's multi-process functionality.



> Create UI tests with Espresso Test Recorder 
 The Espresso Test Recorder tool lets you create UI tests for your app without writing any test code.
 Espresso Test Recorder writes tests based on the Espresso Testing framework, an API in AndroidX Test. The Espresso API encourages you to create concise and reliable UI tests based on user actions.

> Record an Espresso test:
 Espresso tests consist of two primary components: UI interactions and assertions on View elements. UI interactions include tap and type actions that a person may use to interact with your app. Assertions verify the existence or contents of visual elements on the screen.

> Record UI interactions
- Click Run > Record Espresso Test.
- In the Select Deployment Target window, choose the device on which you want to record the test. If necessary, create a new Android Virtual Device. 
- Espresso Test Recorder triggers a build of your project, and the app must  install and launch before Espresso Test Recorder allows you to interact with it.

> Add assertions to verify UI elements:
 Three main types:
- text is: Checks the text content of the selected View element
- exists: Checks that the View element is present in the current View hierarchy visible on the screen
- does not exist: Checks that the View element is not present in the current View hierarchy

> Save a recording

- Click Complete Recording. The Pick a test class name for your test window appears.
- Espresso Test Recorder gives your test a unique name within its package  based on the name of the launched activity. Use the Test class name text field if you want to change the suggested name. Click Save.
  
- The file automatically opens after Espresso Test Recorder generates it, and Android Studio shows the test class as selected in the Project window of the IDE.


> Run an Espresso test locally:

 - Open the desired app module folder and navigate to the test you want to run. The test’s location depends on the location of your instrumentation test root and the package name of the launched activity. 

 - Right-click on the test and click Run ‘testName.’
  Alternatively, you can open the test file and right-click on the generated test class or method. Read more about how to run tests on the Test Your App page.
  
 - In the Select Deployment Target window, choose the device on which you  want to run the test. If necessary, create a new Android Virtual Device. Click OK.
