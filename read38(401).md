> SNS
 Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also known as producers and consumers).




> Application integration
  when a message published to an SNS topic is replicated and pushed to multiple endpoints, such as Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams, Amazon SQS queues, HTTP(S) endpoints, and Lambda functions. This allows for parallel asynchronous processing.

> Application alerts
 Application and system alerts are notifications that are triggered by predefined thresholds. Amazon SNS can send these notifications to specified users via SMS and email. 

> User notifications
 Amazon SNS can send push email messages and text messages (SMS messages) to individuals or groups.

> Mobile push notifications
 Mobile push notifications enable you to send messages directly to mobile apps.

> Amazon SNS steps:
 - Step 1: Create a topic
 - Step 2: Create a subscription to the topic
 - Step 3: Publish a message to the topic
 - Step 4: Delete the subscription and topic
