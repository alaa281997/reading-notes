#### The HTTP Request Lifecycle
> Local Processing
 - Your browser extracts the "scheme"/protocol (<protocol>://<host><:optional port>/<path/to/resource><?query>)
 - Browser hostname for the request to resolve an IP address

> Resolve an IP
 - The DNS request contains the preconfigured IP for your DNS server and your return IP in its header.
 - Request will now have to travel many network devices to reach its target DNS server.
 - Once your request arrives at your configured DNS server, the server looks for the address associated with the requested hostname.

> Establish a TCP Connection
- One of the key differences between TCP and UDP is that TCP ensures delivery and ordered data transmission
-  The server must already be "listening" on a port, performing a passive open, after which the client can initiate an active open.
-  connection where both the client and server have received acknowledgment of the connection from the other party

> Send an HTTP Request
- The body content of an HTTP request is completely optional,  but often contains something like form data or JSON.
- The server can ensure it receives the whole request, in the correct order
- The status line contains an HTTP status code indicating the success, failure, or error-state of the request along with a "reason message" that provides detail.
-  For every two packets that the client receives at the TCP layer, it sends an ACK message to the server.


> Tearing Down and Cleaning Up
- the client sends a FIN packet at the TCP level, to which the server responds with an ACK, and then generally sends a FIN of its own, which the client responds to with its own ACK signal. 
- At this point, your browser begins processing what it has received.

### HttpUrlConnection
>  The HttpUrlConnection class allows us to perform basic HTTP  requests without the use of any additional libraries. All the classes that we need are part of the java.net package.

>  Creating a Request
We can create an HttpUrlConnection instance using the openConnection() method of the URL class.

>  Adding Request Parameters
 we have to set the doOutput property to true, then write a String of the form param1=valueÂ¶m2=value to the OutputStream of the HttpUrlConnection

> Setting Request Headers
 Adding headers to a request can be achieved by using the setRequestProperty() method

>  Configuring Timeouts
 HttpUrlConnection class allows setting the connect and read timeouts. These values define the interval of time to wait for the connection to the server to be established or data to be available for reading

> Handling Cookies
 CookieManager and HttpCookie
 First, to read the cookies from a response, we can retrieve the value of the Set-Cookie header and parse it to a list of HttpCookie objects

> Handling Redirects
 We can enable or disable automatically following redirects for a specific connection by using the setInstanceFollowRedirects() method with true or false parameter

> Reading the Response
 Reading the response of the request can be done by parsing the InputStream of the HttpUrlConnection instance.

> Reading the Response on Failed Requests
 the InputStream of the HttpUrlConnection instance won't work. Instead, we can consume the stream provided by HttpUrlConnection.getErrorStream().

> Building the Full Response
 Build it using some of the methods that the HttpUrlConnection instance offers
