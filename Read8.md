> Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can
control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the
boxes (and sometimes the height, too). 


> Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.
It is common to group a number of elements together inside a <div>
(or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together
all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and
the main navigation). The <div> element that contains this group of
elements is then referred to as the containing element.

> positioning
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

>Screen Resolution
 Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

>page sizes
 Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
  designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
  (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).


> Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the
user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
Measurements tend to be given in pixels.

> Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases
or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.

> The liquid layout uses percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design
will stretch to fit the size of the screen.

> Layout Grids
Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.
