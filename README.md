### growth mindset: _It is something you can improve by practice, The growth mindset sees failure as a chance to learn not for defect, The growth mindset looks for creativity and possibility, and achievement of goals._ 


- **Challenges**
  - I challenge my self when stuck in something to achieve it
- **Success of others** 
   - I don't feel jealous of people I thought were more successful or more intelligent.
- **Effort** 
  -  I shouldn't give up easily I should work hard.
