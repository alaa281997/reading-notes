## Spring Security Architecture

> Authentication and Access Control
 - Authentication (who are you?)
 - Authorization (what are you allowed to do?).

 Interface for authentication is AuthenticationManager:
 - Return an Authentication (normally with authenticated=true)  if it can verify that the input represents a valid principal.

 - Throw an AuthenticationException if it believes that the  input represents an invalid principal.

 - Return null if it cannot decide.

 *AuthenticationException is a runtime exception. It is usually handled by an application in a generic way, depending on the style or purpose of the application*

 > Customizing Authentication Managers
 Spring Security provides some configuration helpers to quickly get common authentication manager features set up in your application.

 @Override of a method in the configurer
  The AuthenticationManagerBuilder would be used only to build  a “local” AuthenticationManager
  In a Spring Boot application, you can @Autowired the global one into another bean, but you cannot do that with the local one unless you explicitly expose it yourself.

> Authorization or Access Control
  There are three implementations provided by the framework  like the ProviderManager delegates to AuthenticationProviders. 
  The Object is completely generic in the signatures of the AccessDecisionManager and AccessDecisionVoter

> Web Security
 Spring Security in the web tier (for UIs and HTTP back ends) is based on Servlet Filters helpful to Filters generally

> Creating and Customizing Filter Chains
 @Configuration
 @Order(SecurityProperties.BASIC_AUTH_ORDER - 10)
 public class ApplicationConfigurerAdapter extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.antMatcher("/match1/**")
     ...;
  }
 }
 *This bean causes Spring Security to add a new filter chain and order it before the fallback*

> Request Matching for Dispatch and Authorization
 A security filter chain (or, equivalently, a WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter) has a request matcher that is used to decide whether to apply it to an HTTP request.

 @Configuration
@Order(SecurityProperties.BASIC_AUTH_ORDER - 10)
public class ApplicationConfigurerAdapter extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.antMatcher("/match1/**")
      .authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/match1/user").hasRole("USER")
        .antMatchers("/match1/spam").hasRole("SPAM")
        .anyRequest().isAuthenticated();
  }
 } 

> Combining Application Security Rules with Actuator Rules
 @Configuration
 @Order(ManagementServerProperties.BASIC_AUTH_ORDER + 1)
 public class ApplicationConfigurerAdapter extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.antMatcher("/foo/**")
     ...;
  }
 }

> Method Security
  Spring Security offers support for applying access rules to Java method executions. For Spring Security, this is just a different type of “protected resource”. 
  @SpringBootApplication
 @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true)
 public class SampleSecureApplication {
  }

 Decorate the method resources directly:
 @Service
  public class MyService {

  @Secured("ROLE_USER")
  public String secure() {
    return "Hello Security";
  }

 }

> Working with Threads
   We can always access and manipulate the SecurityContext through static convenience methods in SecurityContextHolder, which, in turn, manipulate a ThreadLocal.



> Spring Auth Cheat Sheet
 - set up a user model and repo
 - create a controller for that model
 - UserDetailsServiceImpl implements UserDetailsService
 - ApplicationUser implements UserDetails (Create boolean method)
 - WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
    - has a UserDetailsService
    - passwordEncoder bean
    - configure AuthManagerBuilder
    - configure HttpSecurity
 - registration page
 -  login page
