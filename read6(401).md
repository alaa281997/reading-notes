# Read class 6

#### Inheritance
 Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes
 In the Java programming language, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses.
 
> Definitions:
  A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).

> Subclass:
 A subclass inherits all of the public and protected members of its parent
 - You can declare new fields in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
 - You can declare a field in the subclass with the same name as the one in the superclass.
 - The inherited methods can be used directly as they are.
 - You can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass.
 - You can write a new static method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass.
 - You can declare new methods in the subclass that are not in the superclass.


> Private
 A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class. However, if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields, these can also be used by the subclass


#### Interfaces
 Implementing an interface allows a class to become more formal about the behavior it promises to provide. Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world, and this contract is enforced at build time by the compiler. 

> An interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method  signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types.

*To use an interface, you write a class that implements the interface.*

> Interfaces as APIs
 A software package that contains complex methods that another company wants to use in its own software product. An example would be a package of digital image processing methods that are sold to companies making end-user graphics programs. The image processing company writes its classes to implement an interface, which it makes public to its customers. The graphics company then invokes the image processing methods using the signatures and return types defined in the interface.
