## Serverless and Amplify

> Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider.

> Serverless applications are event-driven cloud-based systems where application development rely solely on a combination of third-party services.

> Available cloud services:
- AWS Lambda
- Google Cloud Functions
- Azure Functions
- IBM OpenWhisk
- Alibaba Function Compute
- Iron Functions
- Auth0 Webtask
- Oracle Fn Project
- Kubeless

> Networking
The downside is that Serverless functions are accessed only as private APIs. To access these you must set up an API Gateway. 

> 3rd Party Dependencies
Most, if not all of your projects have external dependencies, they rely on libraries that are not built into the language or framework you use.

> Environments
Setting up different environments for Serverless is as easy as setting up a single environment. Given that it’s pay per execution, this is a large improvement over traditional servers, you no longer need to set up dev, staging, and production machines.

> Timeout
With Serverless computing, there’s a hard 300-second timeout limit. Too complex or long-running functions aren’t good for Serverless, but having a hard timeout makes it impossible to perform certain tasks.

> Scale
Scaling process for Serverless is automatic and seamless, but there is a lack of control or entire absence of control. 

> Functions as a Service 
  Is an implementation of Serverless architectures where engineers can deploy an individual function or a piece of business logic. 
 > Principles: 
   - Complete management of servers.
   - Invocation based billing
   - Event-driven and instantaneously scalable

> Key properties:
 - Independent, server-side, logical functions
    Are similar to the functions you’re used to writing in programming languages, small, separate, units of logic that take input arguments, operate on the input and return the result.
 - Stateless
 With Serverless, everything is stateless, you can’t save a file to disk on one execution of your function and expect it to be there at the next.\
 
 - Ephemeral
   Are designed to spin up quickly, do their work and then shut down again. They do not linger unused. As long as the task is performed the underlying containers are scrapped.
 - Event-triggered
  Although functions can be invoked directly, yet they are usually triggered by events from other cloud services such as HTTP requests, new database entries or inbound message notifications.
 - Scalable by default
   With stateless functions multiple containers can be initialised, allowing as many functions to be run (in parallel, if necessary) as needed to continually service all incoming requests.
 - Fully managed by a Cloud vendor
   AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, IBM OpenWhisk and Google Cloud Functions are most well-known FaaS solutions available. 

> Benefits of Serverless Architecture
  *From business perspective*
  -  The cost incurred by a serverless application is based on the number of function executions, measured in milliseconds instead of hours.
  - Process agility: Smaller deployable units result in faster delivery of features to the market, increasing the ability to adapt to change.
  - Cost of hiring backend infrastructure engineers goes down.
  - Reduced operational costs

  *From developer perspective*
  - Reduced liability, no backend infrastructure to be responsible for.
  - Zero system administration.
  - Easier operational management.
  - Fosters adoption of Nanoservices, Microservices, SOA Principles.
  - Faster set up.
  - Scalable, no need to worry about the number of concurrent requests.
  - Monitoring out of the box.
  - Fosters innovation.

  *From user perspective*
   - If businesses are using that competitive edge to ship features faster, then customers are receiving new features quicker than before.
   - It is possible that users can more easily provide their own storage backend(i.e Dropbox, Google Drive).
   - It’s more likely that these kinds of apps may offer client-side caching, which provides a better offline experience.


> Drawbacks of Serverless Architecture
  *From business perspective*
  - Reduced overall control.
  - Vendor lock-in requires more trust for a third-party provider.
  - Additional exposure to risk requires more trust for a third party    provider.
  - Security risk.
  - Disaster recovery risk
  - Cost is unpredictable because the number of executions is not predefined
  - All of these drawbacks can be mitigated with open-source alternatives but at the expense of cost benefits mentioned previously


  *From developer perspective*
   - Immature technology results in component fragmentation, unclear best-practices.
   - Architectural complexity.
   - The discipline required against function sprawl.
   - Multi-tenancy means it’s technically possible that neighbour functions could hog the system resources behind the scenes.
   - Testing locally becomes tricky.
   - Significant restrictions on the local state.
   - Execution duration is capped.
   - Lack of operational tools

  *From user perspective*
   - Unless architected correctly, an app could provide a poor user experience as a result of increased request latency.
