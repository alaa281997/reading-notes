# Read class 7

> SOLID
 SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C.

- S - Single-responsiblity Principle
- O - Open-closed Principle
- L - Liskov Substitution Principle
- I - Interface Segregation Principle
- D - Dependency Inversion Principle

> Single-Responsibility Principle
 A class should have one and only one reason to change.
 the single responsibility principle (srp) asserts that a class or module should do one thing only.
 consider a class that opens a connection to the database, pulls out some table data, and writes the data to a file. this class has multiple reasons to change: adoption of a new database, modified file output format, deciding to use an orm, etc.  in terms of the srp, we'd say that this class is doing too much

> Open-Closed Principle
 Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
 the open/closed principle states that code entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

 Example of this in real life is sitting in your pocket in the form of a smartphone. all such phones have app stores and these app stores let you extend the base functionality of the phone. sure, it ships with the basics: camera operation, actual calls, text messages, etc. but via the app store, you can extend the phone's capabilities to allow you to manage your todo list, play inane video games, and even serve as a flashlight or wireless access point.

> Liskov Substitution Principle
 Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
 Child type of a parent type should be able to stand in for that parent without things blowing up

> Interface Segregation Principle
 A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use. 
 ISP that you should favor many, smaller, client-specific interfaces over one larger, more monolithic interface

> Dependency Inversion Principle
 Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
 Encourages you to write code that depends upon abstractions rather than upon concrete details
 *This principle allows for decoupling.*
